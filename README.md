# Code 201 | LAB - 06

## Project Name: Pat's Salmon Cookies

This app is intended to fulfill the requirements set out in the description of lab 06, namely the following:

1. Pat’s Salmon Cookies needs to calculate the number of cookies each location must make every day so that it can manage its supplies inventory and baking schedule.

2. The number of cookies to make depends on the hours of operation (6:00 AM to 8:00 PM for all locations) and a few factors unique to each location, including the following:

    * The minimum number of customers per hour.
    * The maximum number of customers per hour.
    * The average number of cookies purchased per customer.

3. The application needs to be adaptable: Pat will need to be able to

    * (a) add and remove locations from the daily projections report, 
    * (b) easily modify the input numbers for each location based on day of the week, special events, and other factors. 

4. Pat would like to see these numbers with nice formatting in a web application.

5. Pat is requesting your assistance in the design of the documents, color scheme, fonts, and any additional images for the public facing site.
